# Weather App

This project focuses on creating a Weather Application for user to check the weather condition in their country.

The Weather app is made with React JS, we use the Open Weather Map API to make calls to a restful api to return the current weather data. This uses the Modern Javascript Fetch AP along with React hooks and conditonals.

The website is deployed in Netify with the link below:<br>
