# Weather App

This project focuses on creating a Weather Application for Users to check the weather condition in their country.

The Weather app is made with React JS and use the Open Weather Map API to make calls to a restful api to return the current weather data. This uses the Modern Javascript Fetch AP along with React hooks and conditonals.

The application will:

- Display the Country, Date, Temperature and Weather Status
- Change to a Blue Background if the temperature fall below 16°C and Red Background if the temperature is more than 16°C.

The website is deployed in Netify with the link below:<br>
